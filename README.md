Introduction

Purpose
The Cordychain system is a blockchain-based web application designed to address the authenticity and traceability issues faced by the cordyceps supply and sale industry in Bhutan. This system aims to create an exceptionally secure and transparent supply chain for cordyceps while reducing paperwork and workloads for exporters.


System Overview 
The cordyceps supply chain is made as secure and transparent as possible through Cordychain's use of blockchain technology. Users have the option to register cordyceps packets to keep tamper-proof records of the herb's supply. Additionally, by scanning a QR code on the packaging, stakeholders and customers can confirm the cordyceps' validity.
